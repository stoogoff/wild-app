# 4: Abilities

There are five Abilities which reflect the characters talents, skills and training. These Abilities are **Diplomat**, **Guardian**, **Rogue**, **Scholar** and **Visionary**. Again, these are scored between 1 and 6. You begin by deciding which Ability is your strongest (4), your weakest (1), your second strongest (3) and then giving the remaining two Abilities the score of 2.

# Major Arcana

Reflecting imagery from the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot deck, and incorporating symbolism from some of the most common dreams, the Major Arcana represents images from Clarity's dreamscape, notable characters she encounters, and significant influences upon her conscious and unconscious life.

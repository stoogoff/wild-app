		<h1>6. Finishing Touches</h1>
		<p>By now, youâ€™ll have filled in the character sheet with Attributes, Abilities and Aspects. All that remains are the finishing touches. While some of these are not immediately important, they make them a more complete person. Give them a name, a bit of a background if you have one in mind, and what you imagine they look like.</p>
